## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My app, NativePlantsMO, will serve as a resource for local home gardeners looking to incorporate native plants in their landscaping.
Missouri native plants are well adapted to our extreme weather and provide food and shelter for important wildlife such as birds, bees, butterflies and insects.
A garden planted with Missouri natives is a sustainable landscape which will become easier to care for as it matures and will save you money on water, fertilizer, pesticides and labor.

NativePlantsMO will showcase 50 top performing native plants. Each plant in the database will have an image, description, growing conditions and helpful notes.
Users will be able to search the database according to the following filters: sun, moisture and soil.

This idea emerged out of my own interest in native plants and the lack of user friendly, comprehensive databases to discover such plants.
Often lists are in PDF forms, or are on websites that have a poor user interface or the search function is limited.
Ultimately, users will be able to user my app as a one stop shop for top performing MO native plants.
